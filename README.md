Problem Statement: Group Music Listening Enhancement Application

Introduction:
The Group Music Listening Enhancement Application aims to revolutionize the way people enjoy music together during group activities, such as road trips, parties, restaurants, and social gatherings. It addresses the common challenge of diverse music preferences within a group, where selecting a single playlist often leaves some participants unsatisfied. The application will leverage the Spotify music platform to create a collaborative and inclusive music experience, merging individual playlists from multiple users into a unified playlist that appeals to everyone involved.

Problem Description:
During social events and group activities, individuals often have their own distinct music tastes and preferences. As a result, choosing a single playlist that caters to everyone's liking becomes a significant challenge, leading to compromised musical enjoyment and even dissatisfaction among some participants. The current lack of an efficient and seamless solution for combining diverse playlists often hinders the collective music experience, reducing the overall enjoyment and connection among the group members.

Objectives:
The primary objective of the Group Music Listening Enhancement Application is to create an engaging, harmonious, and inclusive music playlist that incorporates the music preferences of all participants in a group. The application will be developed as an integrated solution for Spotify users, leveraging the existing Spotify music library and user playlists to provide a seamless experience.
